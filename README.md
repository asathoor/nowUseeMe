## What is a webdocumentary?
From the perspective of the designer og communicator a webdocumentary is a visual genre related to storytelling, e.g. in online journalism. From the perspective of the web developer a webdocumentary is just a long html document enhanced by the usual suspects: JavaScript and CSS.

By JavaScript and CSS the webdocumentary comes to life. You can detect where the mouse is, if the arrow hover a certain element, clicks and even if some element is visible or not.

So the webdocumentary is a way to tell a story by human interactions with your screeen.
